# User Analysis Framework - UI Redesign
This is a personal side project focused on improving the UI/UX of a previously developed user analysis framework application.
Originally built as part of a university project, the app allows user to collect, analyze, and manage various types of personal data to gain insights into their digital footprint.

The initial project emphasized functionality and backend logic, while the UI remained minimal.
This redesign effort explores how to elevate usability, clarity, and visual consistency in a privacy-sensitive context.
